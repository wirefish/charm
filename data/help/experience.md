You gain experience by performing difficult acts; examples include killing
enemies, crafting items, or completing quests. Experience can be spent to join
or increase your level within `help:guilds`.

The purple bar near the top of your screen shows your current experience and the
amount needed to increase to the next level. Joining a new guild (which
makes you level one with that guild) has the same cost.

You can freely accumulate experience beyond the amount needed for your next
level. To spend it, you must find a guildmaster for the appropriate guild and
use the `help:guild` command.

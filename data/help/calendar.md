The Atalean calendar is divided into twelve months, each with thirty days. Each
year is considered to begin on the first day of spring. The months are:

- Nisanu (beginning of spring)
- Aru
- Simanu
- Dumuzu (beginning of summer)
- Abu
- Ululu
- Tisitum (beginning of autumn)
- Samna
- Kislimu
- Tebetum (beginning of winter)
- Sabatu
- Addaru

Each day begins at dawn and is divided into eight hours: dawn, morning,
noontide, afternoon, evening, dusk, night, and pre-dawn.

The `date` command displays the current hour, day, month, and year.

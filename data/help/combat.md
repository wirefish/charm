You can enter combat by using the `help:attack` command, or when something pulls you
into combat by attacking you.

While in combat you will automatically perform basic attacks based on the
weapons you are wielding. In addition, certain actions become available to you.
For example, you can cast offensive `help:spells` or use special attack
`help:skills`.

Certain actions are restricted while in combat. For example, you cannot move to
another location unless your foe is incapacitated or decides to let you leave.

You normally remain in combat until either you or your foe dies. To attempt to
escape before you die, use the `help:flee` command. Be warned: retreat is not
always possible. You can also try the `help:yield` command; if your foe is
merciful, you may be granted clemency.

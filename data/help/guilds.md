Guilds are organizations that instruct their members in skills related to a
certain specialization. You gain power and abilities by joining guilds and
increasing your rank within them.

Some guilds focus on combat skills. You must spend `help:karma` to increase your
rank with such guilds. Examples are the guilds of warriors, mages, druids, and
vagabonds. These guilds are open to all.

In addition, there exist more specialized and selective combat guilds. These
guilds teach techniques that are often more powerful, but also more narrowly
focused. They also require that you meet certain prerequisites before joining.

Another type of guild, called a trade guild, focuses on gathering and crafting
skills. Joining a trade guild typically costs a small amount of gold. Increasing
your rank within the guild simply requires that you perform relevant actions,
such as gathering resources or crafting items. As your rank increases, new
skills become available and you become more proficient in the skills you already
know.

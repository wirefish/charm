The game world is divided into a large number of locations. A variety of
commands allow you to move from one location to another.

The most general movement command is `go`, which must be followed by the name of
the place you want to go. This can be a direction or an object you want to
enter. For example, `go north` or `go stagecoach`.

Shortcuts exist for the common directions. For example, `north` or `n` is
equivalent to `go north`. Other directional shortcuts are `northeast` or `ne`,
`east` or `e`, `southeast` or `se`, `south` or `s`, `southwest` or `sw`, `west`
or `w`, `northwest` or `nw`, `up`, and `down`.

If you want to move from inside of something to outside, you can use `go out`
or, equivalently, `exit`. Similarly, to move from outside something to inside,
you can use `go in` or `enter`.

Karma is a special currency you gain every time your level increases. You can
spend karma to learn `help:skills`, which in turn grant you special abilities
and traits.

Skills are taught by non-player characters called trainers. You can find
trainers in most settlements across the world. Some more specialized trainers
can be harder to find.

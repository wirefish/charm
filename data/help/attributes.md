Attributes are properties of your avatar that influence your capabilities in
`help:combat`. They fall into two groups, called primary and secondary
attributes.

Primary attributes naturally increase each time you gain a level. In addition,
they can be modified by your race, equipment, skills, and any auras applied to
you. The primary attributes are:

- *Strength* increases the damage done by your physical attacks.

- *Intellect* increases the damage done by your elemental and magical attacks.

- *Vitality* increases your maximum health.

- *Toughness* increases your armor, which protects you from physical and
  elemental attacks.

Secondary attributes are much like primary attributes; the only difference is
that they do not increase when you gain a level. The secondary attributes are:

- *Willpower* increases your magic resistance, which protects you from magical
  attacks.

- *Compassion* increases the effectiveness of your healing abilities.

- *Precision* increases the chance that your abilities may score a critical hit,
  dramatically increasing their effect.

- *Ferocity* increases the magnitude of your critical hits.

- *Evasion* increases your chance of dodging attacks aimed at you.

- *Accuracy* reduces the chance that your attacks miss their target.

- *Spirit* increases your maximum energy.

- *Insight* increases your maximum mana.

- *Resilience* increases the rate at which you regenerate health, energy, and
  mana.

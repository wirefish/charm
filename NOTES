COMBAT

Combat is a mode. When an entity enters combat, its allowed set of actions is
limited until it leaves combat. There are three ways to leave combat: (1) die,
(2) flee, or (3) all your opponents leave combat.

While in combat, an avatar has the following fields set:

- `attack-target` is the ID of the entity currently being targeted by
  autoattacks, and the default target for special attacks.

- `assist-target` is nil or the ID of the entity that is the default target for
  helpful abilities.

- `opponents` is a list of the IDs of all enemies with whom the avatar is in
  combat.

- `attack-timer` is a non-nil timer event used to perform autoattacks.

While in combat, a mob has the following fields set:

- `opponents` is an alist of pairs (target-id . threat-level), sorted by
  decreasing threat-level. The mob decides which opponent to target with each
  attack, by default choosing the one with the highest threat. Every entity with
  whom the mob is in combat will appear in this list.

- `attack-timer` is a non-nil timer event used to perform attacks. At each tick
  the mob decides which of its attacks to perform.

- `looters` is a list of the IDs of actors who may loot the mob's corpse after
  it dies. This includes everyone who has been in combat with the mob since it
  spawned or reset.

An avatar enters combat using either the `attack` command or the `assist`
command, or when an aggressive mob attacks on its own.

The `attack` command sets `attack-target`, adds the target to `opponents` if it
isn't already there, and starts `attack-timer` if it is nil.

The `assist` command sets `assist-target`, sets `attack-target` (if not already
set) to that of the assisted entity, and merges the assisted entity's
`opponents` into the avatar's `opponents`. It also starts `attack-timer` if it
is nil.

When any entity exits combat:

- Its `attack-timer` is canceled and set to nil.

- For each entity in its `opponents` list, it is removed from that entity's
  `opponents`.

- Its `opponents`, `attack-target`, and `assist-target` are cleared.

When a mob dies, it exits combat as described aboce. If an avatar's `opponents`
becomes empty, the avatar exits combat as well. Otherwise a new attack target is
selected from its remaining opponents.

When an avatar goes unconscious (i.e. reaches 0 health), it exits combat as
described above. It a mob's `opponents` becomes empty, that mob exits combat as
well.

When an avatar exits the room, every mob in its `opponents` gets a free "attack
of opportunity" with bonuses (no block, no dodge, increased crit chance?) before
the avatar exits combat. (Mobs may block the exit attempt entirely.)

Some actions cannot be used in combat:

- NPC interactions like talk, skill, buy, sell, ...

Performing an action (other than help and social actions like say, yell, chat)
while in combat:

- uses spirit, based on the action

- triggers a GCD, a cooldown before another combat action can be performed.

Many actions are instant, others take time (e.g. a spell with a cast time)
before they complete. The GCD begins once the action completes.

The GCD is shown using a small pie/clock widget at the right end of the command
entry box, or maybe a yellow bar above it? Once it expires maybe a message like
"You are now ready to perform another action."

For an avatar, each tick of `attack-timer` performs basic attacks with each
equipped weapon. The timer is based on the speed of the main-hand weapon. The
number of attacks per tick for the off-hand weapon is based on its speed
relative to the main-hand weapon.

A mob defines a basic attack and a set of special attacks. Each special attack
has an associated cooldown; after being used it cannot be used again until the
cooldown expires.

For a mob, each tick of `attack-timer` randomly selects either its basic attack
or a special attack that is off cooldown. It then performs that attack against a
selected target, which by default is its highest-threat opponent.

Combat actions can be invoked via skill-specific commands (e.g. kick, punch,
bash, ...) or, if spells, via the "cast" command, alias "!". Actually maybe
everything can be used either way, spells might have a command equivalent (e.g.
"magmis" for "magic missile"). Also, in "cast", normal token matching rules
occur against your known skills. So you could type any of:

      cast mag mis
      magmis
      !magic missile at/on goblin

Skill-specific commands don't know up in the generic "help" output, at least
until you learn them. But the skills appear in "skill list" and typing "help
<skill>" works.

The spirit cost of a skill is expressed as a fraction of base spirit. Base
spirit is calculated based on race and level, without accounting for modifiers
due to auras or equipment. Efficacy is also scaled by level.

The idea is that spirit is a generic resource for all actions, physical or
magical. It could be split into, say, energy for physical and mana for magicial.
But because of the classless, skill-based system that would make it very
difficult to gear for a hybrid build with a mix of physical and magical skills.

========================================

COMBAT STATS

The overall feel is more toward D&D and less toward WoW. Specifically, the goal
is to avoid exponential scaling and an overwhelming gear treadmill. Also, keep
it simple.

Combat relies on three resources:

- health: Hit points. When they hit zero, a mob dies and an avatar goes
  unconscious. Regenerates slowly in combat, faster out of combat. Computed
  based on base-health, level, endurance, traits, and auras.

- energy: A resource used to perform physical actions, including movement.
  Regenerates quickly in or out of combat. Computed based on traits and auras.

- mana: A resource used to cast spells and perform actions. Regenerates slowly
  in or out of combat. Computed based on base-mana, level, intellect, traits,
  and auras.

It also relies on a number of modifiers that influence how attacks are resolved:

- armor: Reduces damage from physical and elemental (a subset of magical)
  attacks. Computed by summing (racial) natural armor and contributions from
  equipment, traits, and auras.

- strength: Increases physical damage done.

- precision: Increases chance of a critical hit with any physical or magical
  attack or heal. Defaults to 5%.

- ferocity: Increases multiplier applied to a critical effect. Defaults to 1.5.

- evasion: Increases chance to dodge an attack. Defaults to 5%.

- accuracy: Reduces miss chance. Defaults to 5%.

- resilience: Increases regen rate for health, energy, and mana.

- intellect: Increases elemental and magical damage done.

- piety: Increases healing done.

- resistances: damage reduction against different types of attacks. Each value
  determines the amount of damage nullified from each attack.

For some modifiers that increase damage done or reduce damage taken, the value
is computed by just scaling the modifier by some constant. Modifier values
naturally increase with level, as does damage. Armor, strength, resilience,
intellect, and piety fall into this group.

Armor is just a convenient synonym for "resistance to physical and elemental
damage" and is broken out because it is so common on armor, and probably needs a
different scaling factor.

The magnitude of a modifier's effect depends on its value and the level of the
entity to be effected. This means that an item which grants 10 intellect might
increase damage against level 1 creatures by 10%, but against level 10 creatures
its effect is diminished.

#|

Functions that support examining the contents of the player's inventory and
moving items within, into, or out of inventory.

There are a number of verbs/events that interact with inventory in this way:

- get/take: environment -> inventory
- put: inventory -> inventory or environment
- drop: inventory -> location (specialized form of put)
- discard: inventory -> gone
- equip: inventory -> equipment
- unequip: equipment -> inventory
- give: NPC -> inventory

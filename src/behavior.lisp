(defmacro defbehavior (name (actor &rest args) (&rest vars) &body states)
  "Defines a function `name` with arguments `actor` and `args`. When called, the
  function begins running a behavior on `actor` and returns a closure that can
  be called to stop the behavior. Each instance of the behavior has local
  variables `vars` which can be initialized based on `args`. Each state is
  similar to a case clause; it comprises a state name (typically a keyword) and
  a sequence of forms to execute when entering that state. Within a state, the
  function `change-state` can be called to transition to a new state; it takes a
  required `state` argument and an keyword `delay` argument that specifies a
  delay in seconds before entering the new state. The special :stop state is
  executed when the cancel closure is run, and must not initiate a transition to
  any other state."

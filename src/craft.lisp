  "Attempt to craft *item*, optionally adding *extra-materials* to enhance the
  quality or attributes of the result.

  In order to craft an item, you must:

  - Have achieved the required rank in the appropriate skill;

  - Have an appropriate tool equipped;

  - Have all the required materials (as specified in the `help:recipe`) and
    optional extra materials in your inventory; and

  - Be near an appropriate crafting station.

  If all of the above conditions are met, you will see a message that lists the
  materials that will be consumed and displays your chance of success. You can
  then type `help:accept` to continue with the crafting attempt.

  Crafting takes several seconds. You can save time by crafting multiple
  instances of the same item at once, e.g. `craft 10 iron ingots`. Your chance
  of success applies to each item individually.

  Your crafting attempt will fail if you are interrupted. You can stop crafting
  without any chance of failure by using the `help:stop` command. Note that, if
  your attempt fails, there is a chance you will lose some of the crafting
  materials you used."

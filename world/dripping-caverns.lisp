These caverns are the long-time home of the myconids -- a friendly fungus race
-- and the rockeaters, creatures who devour rocks to survive. The myconids have
been able to live in relative peace with the rockeaters by giving them 'shinies'
as gifts, e.g. jade or copper. The rockeaters especially prize those and eat
them whole instead of grinding them into dust first.

Recently a group of undergnomes passed through and discovered an ancient
altar-like object. They also captured a dwarven explorer who was already there,
studying the artifact.

The undergnomes chased the myconids out of that section of the caverns --
depriving them of access to the caverns where dewcaps, a prized delicacy, are
found -- and began trying to understand the artifact, with the coerced help of
the dwarf.

The artifact can be activated as long as specific stones are placed into four
sockets. These 'shinies' were eaten by rockeaters long ago. An inscription on
the artifact itself provides clues as to which stone must be placed in each
socket.

A rockeater can be induced to vomit its 'shinies' by feeding it a concoction
made from something found in the caverns, as described by the myconid shaman. Or
you can just kill them.

Placing stones incorrectly causes electrical damage, spread across all creatures
near the artifact.

Placing stones correctly causes the entire room containing the artifact room to
rotate, so that the entrance points west instead of east. This blocks access to
the room from the undergnome camp, but provides access to a new passage.

Down that passage is a guardian golem and, beyond that, a treasure chest that is
the reward at the end of this story.

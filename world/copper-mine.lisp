(in-package :copper-mine)

#|

An old copper mine was abandoned years ago, and subsequently occupied by a band
of kobolds. The kobolds hide in the mine as protection against the spiders in
Silverwood. They also cultivate mushrooms (a delicacy, second only to fresh
meat) and prey upon the occasional wanderer who is foolish enough to enter the
mine.
